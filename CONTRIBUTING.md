A special thanks you everyone who has contributed so far!

## Running the Test Suite

Make sure that you have the development dependencies installed. You'll either
need to have run `composer install --dev` initially or `composer update`

When the development dependencies are installed, you can run the test suite
like this:

    $ cd tests/
    $ ../vendor/bin/phpunit

## Submitting a Pull Request

Please include PHPUnit tests with your pull request. If you're not familiar
with PHPUnit, you can learn more about it at [http://phpunit.de/](http://phpunit.de/)

If you have passing tests and [a good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html),
I'll accept your pull request as soon as possible.
